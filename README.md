# markov-music

Quick and dirty implementation of a computer-music generator using markov chains. The code was kept relatively clean and well-commented as to demonstrate the simplicity of markov-chains model. This is obviously a fairly shallow implementation, but can easily be built upon. 

Input: Trainer file in ABC notation
Output: Computer-generated music

Number of notes generated can be changed in main.py

Using (Python Libraries):
Pysynth

TODO:
Generate midi files instead
Optimize random walk
