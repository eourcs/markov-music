# markov-music

Quick and dirty implementation of a computer-music generator using markov chains. The code was kept relatively clean and well-commented as to demonstrate the simplicity of markov-chains model. This is obviously a fairly shallow implementation, but can easily be built upon. 


Amount of notes generated can be changed in main.py


Input: Trainer file in ABC notation or (step, beat) notation

Output: Computer-generated music


Using (Python Libraries):

Pysynth


TODO:

Generate midi files instead
